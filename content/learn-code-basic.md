## It's ok to be a n00b (aka newbie)

Everyone needs to learn to speak over years of practice. Software is the same!

## Hello Mulan

Before we do anything lets just try an example.
```javascript
alert("hello mulan");
```


## Real example

Add **hello mulan** into the alert below and then click the button until you get the text to appear. If you make a mistake it's ok, just click refresh.

```javascript react-live=true
<button style={{backgroundColor:"green", color: "white", padding: 10}} onClick={() => alert('')}>Try me</button>
```
