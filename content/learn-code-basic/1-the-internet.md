## What the internet is made out of

### Hello hooman.

<div style="overflow: hidden;height:155px;width:280px;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/gLiF33BOqzscX1YWYO" width="267" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed"></iframe></div>

Like hooman languages, machine languages are similar. A great example is the internet:

- Nouns (HTML)
- Verbs (Computer Languages Ex. Javascript)
- Adjectives (CSS)

## HTML

Remember that button we clicked before? Thats called HTML (Hyper-Text-Meta-Language meh).
```html
<button/>
```

There are around 100 HTML elements (we won't be covering them today) but it's important to know where you get your food from.

## CSS

Remember that button was green? The CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) was the language used to color it. Go ahead and change the **green** to **red** below.

```javascript react-live=true
<button style={{backgroundColor:"green", color: "white", padding: 10}} onClick={() => alert('hello mulan')}>Try me</button>
```

We also won't be spending much time today on CSS, but the next time you load a page and see red, you'll know why.

## Javascript

Now here comes the fun part. Javascript is the laguage used to make meaning out of the internet. Every time you click a button on a web page, send a message to a friend, or pretty much anything on the internet it's powered by javascript. 

Remember the alert `function`, that was javascript:

```javascript
alert("hello mulan");
```

## Further

Also we won't be covering a lot today, but javascript has a **LOT** of functions. [Check them out one day.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference) But for now let's have some fun.

To actually see the internet at work right click on your browser window and click *"inspect"* and take a look around.
