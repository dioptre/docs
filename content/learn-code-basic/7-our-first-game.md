## Lets get better by copying someone else

- Go here: https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/ 
- Now play the game. Yep. That's the hard part :)

## Think how you might copy it

## Getting you started

- Make a duplicate of my starter that comes with all the sounds needed to create the game.

Hint: To get started, try playing a sound when the mouse moves to the right of the screen. Try 100 pixels?
