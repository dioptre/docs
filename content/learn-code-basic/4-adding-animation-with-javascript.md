## Draw a circle

We'll see more and more `functions` don't be afraid of them. They're here to help! In the following example there is:
- ellipse (draw an ellipse/circle at your mouse-x-position, mouse-y-position, with-width-in-pixels, with-height-in pixels)

Click on **play** to get started. Try changing the values (you can also replace mouseX and mouseY with numbers).

## Drawing circles without a trail

How about if we added a background before every animation (**draw** function)? Would the circle trail disappear? Let's try resetting the view before each circle is drawn. Try it out! If you feel super advanced try and change the background color too.

> Hint: The order in which you run things matter.
