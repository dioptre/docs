## Introduction to IF...THEN...ELSE
*IF* you want to do things in programming you need to learn a little logic. Not much! But *IF* you are going to eat ice-cream you are going to want to open your mouth first.


Basic logic operators in javascript (IF):

- && and
- || or
- ! not
- == equals
- != not-equals
- ({}) Braces (do this first)

## A Short Example

```javascript
if ((youPickYouNose && youEatIt) || (!youBrushYourTeeth)) {
    alert("you'll get sick")
} else {
    alert('you'll stay healthy')
}
if (true == false) {
    alert('hi')
}if (true != false) {
    alert('hi')
}
```

## A Real Example

Notice why the circles are only coming up in the bottom-right corner?
